Astro Live Code works by generating files out of the code blocks and naming them something like `AstroExample_XYZ.jsx`, where the extension is determined by the code block language.
This will be an issue if you are using multiple JSX frameworks as Astro can't know which framework to use without changes to the filename.

To solve this, you can manually specify the file extension with the `ext` meta attribute and use that to match against your 
[Astro integrations](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/preact/#combining-multiple-jsx-frameworks).

First, edit your `astro.config.mjs` to look something like this:

```js title="astro.config.mjs"
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import preact from '@astrojs/preact';
import react from '@astrojs/react';
import solid from '@astrojs/solid-js';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [
    preact({
      include: ['**/*.preact.*'],
    }),
    react({
      include: ['**/*.react.*'],
    }),
    solid({
      include: ['**/*.solid.*'],
    }),
  ],
});
```

Then specify the file extension on the codeblock

````
```jsx live ext="solid.jsx"
...
```
````

```jsx live ext="solid.jsx"
import { For } from 'solid-js'

export default () => {
  const items = ['a', 'b', 'c']
  return (
    <For each={items}>{(item) => <span>{item}</span>}</For>
  )
}
```
