Diff syntax is supported when used with Expressive Code. [See their docs on using diff syntax](https://expressive-code.com/key-features/text-markers/#combining-syntax-highlighting-with-diff-like-syntax).
(If you are using Starlight, Expressive Code is already included.)

Lines that begin with `-` are removed from the rendered code.

````
```diff live lang="html"
<div>
-  <button>hello world</button>
+  <button>hello new world</button>
</div>
```
````

becomes

```diff live lang="html"
<div>
- <button>hello world</button>
+ <button>hello new world</button>
</div>
```
